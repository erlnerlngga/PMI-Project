# **Business Intelligence Model For PMI Emergency Warehouse**

## **Backgrounds**

The Indonesian Red Cross Society (Indonesian: Palang Merah Indonesia) is a humanitarian organization in Indonesia. It is a member of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. One of disaster happened in Indonesia is covid-19, so when it happened PMI build 7 emergency warehouse with 4 additional emergency warehouse. So we  want to help pmi to monitor emergency warehouse activities. PMI current data have several variable is like in/out items activity, warehouse, date, items name, total, destination/origin of delivery, price, and weight.

We found several obstacles faced by emergency warehouse staff in carrying out their activities, such as:
- Is there a unique item id and expire date is recorded?
- Is there a categorization of items that will facilitate storage and monitoring in the warehouse?
- Why can't expired items be detected? Is it possible that the items that came out only see the need for the number of requests? Or is there a system that determines which item will be came out first?
- What items have a high level of demand and turnover? Are there any dead stock items (items come in without/very minimal outgoing requests)?
- Thats mean the availability of these goods needs to be ensured. If you look at the history, when do we have to order stock and how much stock do we need?

## **Objectives**
- Create product data that can display information on the quantity stock of items in real time.
- Create categories of items for planning purposes and stock replenishment.
- Implementing the right inventory management method FIFO (First In First Out), to avoid expired items and implementing a good items in and out system.
